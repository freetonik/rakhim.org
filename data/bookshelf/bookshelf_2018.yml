      I liked the first 10% of the book because it was full of promise, and the last 5% because it was finally ending. Cool idea, meandering execution, utterly non-rewarding. I've seen some reviewers complaining about "too much scientific stuff", but there wasn't enough! Every time it came to some clever muggle science and magic crossover, I was excited like a little kid, but every time it was abrupt and anticlimactic. No experiments, no exploration, no curiosity at all. I got hooked by the promise of a "scientific Harry Potter finally being a sane person", which, I now realise, was more of a wishful thinking on my part. So I can say I didn't enjoy this book as much as I expected presicely because I had some pretty specific expectations. The book is exhausting in its self-absorbed "rationality". I found myself bored quite often, but kept insisting on the temporary nature of it, since so many smart people were raving about it. Also, actions don't seem to have consequences in this universe, so after reading about a third of the book, I lost all interest and couldn't manage to invest emotionally into the story or the characters.

  - title: "Mastering Emacs"
    author: "Mickey Petersen"
    isbn: "00000000036128"
    comment: "A very good book about Emacs. Lots of details, but not too much, so that you don't feel overwhelmed. It teaches you how to learn and explore yourself, which is often overlooked by authors."

  - title: "Finish"

      It's a self-help book, alright. It's very nicely written and I enjoyed it. But, as always, it can be summed up in a short blog post. But hey, it was entertaining!

  - title: "The Dip"
    author: "Seth Godin"

      Short, concise, quite important to me. I have troubles deciding when to quit, and I think I made multiple mistakes of not recognizing the context in which making a decision (any decision!) was paramount.



  - title: "Endymion"
    author: "Dan Simmons"
    features: yes

      It's one of those books that I actually hope won't be made into a movie any time soon, since it's so good and the universe is so humongous, I can't imagine a non-disappointing movie adaptation. (another one of those is the Chronicles of Amber series by Roger Zelazny). Endymion is 3rd in the Hyperion Cantos, and because the story is so much further in time from the original 2 parts of Hyperion, I hesitated before starting it. I just didn't expect it to be as good. I thought "well, all the good parts are over now, and the civilisation has ended". Deeper religious connotations didn't attract me either. But oh man was I wrong! Endymion is on par with the first two books. It feels extremely natural and authentic. I guess the whole cantos should be considered as one huge book, that's it. It's different, though. Unlike the first two books, there aren't that many characters to keep track of. The story is simpler indeed, but it's still intriguing in its complexity. If you like space operas, I highly recommend it.

  - title: "12 Rules for Life"
    author: "Jordan B. Peterson"
    features: yes
    isbn: 9780241351659
    comment: "One of the most important books for me as far as non-fiction goes. Philosophy, religion and psychology under the mask of a self-help book."

  - title: "Design for the Real World: Human Ecology and Social Change"
    author: "Victor Papanek"
    isbn: 9780500231654
    comment: "I got somewhat sad after reading this book. It's wonderful, but the contrast between the ideas and values expressed in it and the reality of our disposable, badly designed world are striking. 'Sustainable' became a gimmick, a filler word for presentations just like 'organic' or 'natural'. Why would anything be not sustainable? Why would anyone design something non sensible? Why can anybody not feel responsibility when designing things? Well, let's party while we can, I guessâ€¦"

  - title: "The Pursuit of Perfect"
    author: Tal Ben-Shahar
    isbn: 9788492414963
    comment: "Many people call themselves perfectionists, but, to be honest, most of them aren't in most cases. But every once in a while there is a time, a certain set of circumstances where you can't do anything but strive for the impossible. This is a great little book about perfectionism. And yes, I will end this sentence with a comma,"

  - title: "So Good They Can't Ignore You"
    author: Cal Newport
    isbn: 9780349420219
    comment: "A nicely written case against the 'follow your passion' advice with a well-defined career-building strategy. As many non-fiction sel-help books, could be at least 10 times shorter, but hey, it's pretty good."

  - title: "The Psychedelic Explorer's Guide: Safe, Therapeutic, and Sacred Journeys"
    author: James Fadiman
    isbn: 9781594774027
    comment: This is a fascinating topic, and there's a lot of BS floating around it. This book is one of the good ones.
