  <p>
    Here are some of the books I have read lately.
  </p>

  <h3>2018</h3>
  <div>
    
      <div class="book">

  <div class="book_descriptuon">
    <h4>
      
      <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=Endymion">
        Endymion, <i class="book_author">by Dan Simmons</i>
      </a>
    </h4>
    <p class="mt2">It's one of those books that I actually hope won't be made into a movie any time soon, since it's so good and the universe is so humongous, I can't imagine a non-disappointing movie adaptation. (another one of those is the Chronicles of Amber series by Roger Zelazny). Endymion is 3rd in the Hyperion Cantos, and because the story is so much further in time from the original 2 parts of Hyperion, I hesitated before starting it. I just didn't expect it to be as good. I thought "well, all the good parts are over now, and the civilisation has ended". Deeper religious connotations didn't attract me either. But oh man was I wrong! Endymion is on par with the first two books. It feels extremely natural and authentic. I guess the whole cantos should be considered as one huge book, that's it. It's different, though. Unlike the first two books, there aren't that many characters to keep track of. The story is simpler indeed, but it's still intriguing in its complexity. If you like space operas, I highly recommend it.

        12 Rules for Life, <i class="book_author">by Jordan B. Peterson</i>
      </a>
    </h4>
    <p class="mt2">One of the most important books for me as far as non-fiction goes. Philosophy, religion and psychology under the mask of a self-help book.</p>

        Design for the Real World: Human Ecology and Social Change, <i class="book_author">by Victor Papanek</i>
      </a>
    </h4>
    <p class="mt2">I got somewhat sad after reading this book. It's wonderful, but the contrast between the ideas and values expressed in it and the reality of our disposable, badly designed world are striking. 'Sustainable' became a gimmick, a filler word for presentations just like 'organic' or 'natural'. Why would anything be not sustainable? Why would anyone design something non sensible? Why can anybody not feel responsibility when designing things? Well, let's party while we can, I guess…</p>

      </a>
    </h4>
    <p class="mt2">Many people call themselves perfectionists, but, to be honest, most of them aren't in most cases. But every once in a while there is a time, a certain set of circumstances where you can't do anything but strive for the impossible. This is a great little book about perfectionism. And yes, I will end this sentence with a comma,</p>

    </h4>
    <p class="mt2">A nicely written case against the 'follow your passion' advice with a well-defined career-building strategy. As many non-fiction sel-help books, could be at least 10 times shorter, but hey, it's pretty good.</p>
