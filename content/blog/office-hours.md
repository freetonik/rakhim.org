As an experiment, I am holding paid office hours for several weeks. I'd love to share whatever limited experience I've gained so far. You can schedule a 30 or 60 minute audio call to talk (in English or Russian) about any of the following topics:

1.  **Computer science and programming**.
    -   Discuss a fascinating idea.
    -   Feeling lost and want to understand something.
    -   No code review or debugging. Consider hiring a private mentor (on sites like codementor.io) for that.

2.  **Software development career**. I have experience being hired and hiring developers, being managed and managing teams, working on client projects, freelancing and on my own private businesses.
    -   How to chose what to learn and where to work.
    -   Freelancing vs. full time work.
    -   How to grow professionally.
    -   How to get promoted.

3.  **Professional immigration**. I've been through several work-, education- and entrepreneurship-based immigration processes in Canada (Federal and Quebec) and Finland.
    -   How to chose a country that suits you and your family.
    -   North America vs. Europe
    -   English exams
    -   Preparation, process, first steps after landing.

4.  **Entrepreneurship and startups**.
    -   Starting your own business.
    -   Raising funds.
    -   Growth, goals and metrics.

5.  **Education and/or immigration**.
    -   Learning English.
    -   What to study in college.
    -   How to study abroad. Scholarships, immigration, work after graduation.

6.  **Self management**.
    -   Getting things done
    -   Focusing on hard tasks
    -   Managing distractions
    -   Reducing mindless browsing, social media influence, digital addictions

7.  Other:
    -   simplifying life
    -   digital essentialism
    -   managing complexity in life
    -   public speaking
    -   podcasting
    -   blogging
    -   ... and almost anything else :)
