I first came to Finland in October 2014, and stayed for one month until mid November. It's arguably the worst time to visit Helsinki: it's dark, windy, rains all the time, there's no snow and the air is super humid. -1C sounds not too bad until you feel it near the Baltic sea. Sun rises around 9am, lazily rolls near the horizon and goes back to sleep at around 3:30pm. You don't see it anyway, as skies are covered with a thick, heavy blanket.

Yet, I fell in love. Today, 5 years later, I can't imagine living elsewhere.

There are good objective reason for and against any location, but ultimately, it comes to personal compatibility. It just happens that Finland and I go along together really well. Today, I want to describe those things that make me love Finland.


## People are nice {#people-are-nice}

I've lived in three countries for substantial periods of time before moving to Finland: Kazakhstan, Canada and Russia. I'd say Canada and Finland get a tie here â€” people are nice, damn it. Canadians do feel more stressed though.

When I say nice I don't mean they smile and hold doors. I mean there's generally never a negative feeling about a stranger.


## People are reliable {#people-are-reliable}

This is a big, big one. Never once in 5 years did someone stood me up, was late to a meeting, forgot something or somehow fucked up. Finns and other Finnish residents are reliable as hell. I never had this experience anywhere before. Kazakhstan is the worst in this regard: people are always late, word doesn't mean much. Canada and Russia were generally _fine_, you get used to the fact that sometimes, things don't work out.

But Finland... It's incredible, really. I'm not exaggerating, I literally couldn't remember a single instance of someone missing a meeting.
