- title: "Design for the Real World: Human Ecology and Social Change"

  comment: "Many people call themselves perfectionists, but, to be honest, most of them aren't in most cases. But every once in a while there is a time, a certain set of circumstances where you can't do anything but strive for the impossible. This is a great little book about perfectionism.

- title: "So Good They Can't Ignore You"
  author: Cal Newport
  isbn: 9780349420219
  comment: "A nicely written case against the 'follow your passion' advice with a well-defined career-building strategy. As many non-fiction sel-help books, could be at least 10 times shorter, but hey, it's pretty good."

  author: James Fadiman
  isbn: 9781594774027
  comment: This is a fascinating topic, and there's a lot of BS floating around it. This book is one of the good ones.
