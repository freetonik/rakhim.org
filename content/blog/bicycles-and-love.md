I love bicycles.

The first memories I have are bike-related. The best ones too.

{{< figure src="/images/posts/Bicycles_and_Love/my_first_bicycle.jpg" >}}

I don't remember a time I didn't bike. Bicycle means freedom.

My first serious bicycles, the ones that let me explore the city, were old, steel soviet tanks. They were simultaneously indestructible and always broken.

My friend Eugene and I spent summers biking around town, forests and river valleys. It was awesome.

Those bikes were universal. Well, at least for us they were. Pavement, gravel, sand, water, whatever. They go where we go. They were simple and stupid, and I loved that. No speeds, no hand brakes.

I haven't even seen a multi-speed bicycle at that time.

I used to live with my grandma until I was 13. Her apartment had a narrow corridor connecting the entrance to the room, and I can't imagine it without a bicycle. It was always there, and when it wasn't, I weren't home. Out biking god knows where.

I had a dream of driving a city bus, so quite often I spent hours biking along the bus routes, stopping at bus stops, emulating a bus. An old pen was diligently placed inside the handlebar, sticking about 2 inches outwards: it was fake my turn signal lever. I had to make the turn signal clicking sound myself, of course.

My next bike was a pretty cool steel Schwinn I got as a gift from my host family in Canada. Bicycle freedom had suddenly expanded. Now I could ride to another province where people speak a different language and traffic lights are horizontal. I could bring my bike on the train and get further than ever. I could disappear into the city and nobody could find me.

Several random used bikes later I decided I'm ready to spend serious bucks and try road biking. With 1000 Canadian dollars in hand, I walked into a bike shop in western Ottawa and got myself a beautiful aluminium Trek 1.1.

Freedom was reinvented once more. With this light, fast bike I could go further than ever before. First 100 km ride was a revelation. Then 350km in 2 day group event. Then 500km in three days. Then more than a 1000 km in a week across multiple provinces to see the ocean.

I was in love again.

Now I feel like I'm bragging. Don't worry, while these numbers _might_ look impressive, they were occasional bursts. Most of the time I only biked within the city, to work and to get groceries.

Biking and computer science made perfect sense to me. Both are about efficiency. Both are tools, but at the same time fun in and of themselves. Both let you be alone.

After moving from Canada to Kazakhstan, I stopped biking. It took me almost 5 years to re-ignite the passion.

After moving to Finland, I decided to try a single speed and got a pretty Swedish Stålhästen Sport fixed gear bike with a flip-flop hub. Fixed gear is not my cup of tea, so I flipped the wheel and started discovering Helsinki area.

It was pretty sexy.

But alas, we weren't for each other. We just didn't click. A bicycle is an intimate object for me, along with backpacks and computers. I can't just have one, I must love it. So I sold it to someone who, hopefully, loved it.

And got myself a cyclocross Kona Rove Al 2015.

{{< figure src="/images/posts/Bicycles_and_Love/kona_rove_al.jpeg" >}}

The relationship with this one was complicated. I loved it and sometimes hated it.

I loved my Kona because it was very comfortable, fast and looked very cool. Its brownish color was a perfect fit for the forests and fields I took it to. Disc brakes — first for me — made me more confident on narrow descents and uneven terrain.

But I didn't love the maintenance. It was equipped with the cheapest components. Decent, but not awesome. Shimano Claris groupset and mechanic disc brakes were never perfect. The bike was never perfectly tuned, perfectly silent. And I'm ashamed to admit, but I'm a crappy handyman when it comes to bikes. Actually, I'm a crappy handyman in all areas where "undo" is not an option, but I'm particularly bad with bicycles. Derailleur adjustment and disc brake calibration are black magic to me. Hours of sweat and profanity and I end up with a subpar configuration. It works and it's fine, but it's just not very good. Then I say "screw this!" and bring the bike to a mechanic.

By the way, good bike mechanics are pretty expensive in Finland.

I've later learned that better groupsets and hydraulic brakes (or at least the hybrid dual piston ones) are so much better, and I honestly almost convinced myself to spend two grand on a _very good bicycle_. Because then I will ride more, right?

Kona Rove Al was my bike for three good seasons, but the furthest I took it was a 120 km one day ride. It never saw other regions of the country even. We weren't too adventurous together.

This summer, after another failed attempt to eliminate 100% of the disc brakes noise, I decided to say goodbye to Kona and look for something new.

A romanticized and, perhaps, irrational desire to simplify struck me again. What is the simplest bicycle possible? Single speed with coaster brake. I love handbrakes, so, rim brakes then. But I wasn't sure I could do single speed again. I love my knees.

Then I discovered internal hubs. They look and feel like single speed from the outside: no derailleur, no cable slack. My girlfriend and I got ourselves small folding bikes with Shimano Nexus 3-speed hubs and they are very nice. Simple, reliable, solid.

There also exist 7 speed Nexus hubs, but I haven't tried it. They are pretty heavy and it's a pain to install them with dropbars.

Turns out, there are also automatic hubs! Woah! Extremely curious, I got myself an old Fixie Inc. Floater with Sram Automatix 2-speed automatic hub.

{{< figure src="/images/posts/Bicycles_and_Love/fixie_floater_sram.jpg" >}}

The experience is... interesting. You just start pedalling and at about 15 km/h the gear changes automatically. It's pretty solid, no wobble or anything. It's like you're suddenly teleported into higher gear. This shift point it ridiculously low though. It was pretty easy to disassemble the hub and change the shift point by unwinding a tiny metallic spring ([here's a good description](https://bikesfornoreason.blogspot.com/2014/01/sram-automatix-2-speed-hack.html?m=1)).

At first this seemed like a good compromise. Almost as simple as a single speed, but the second gear allows to keep a sane cadence at higher speeds. Unfortunately, the hub is not as isolated from the outside world as other internal gear hubs, so it will require some maintenance.

I took it on multiple rides and just didn't love it. What a picky, delicate flower I am.

And then, completely by chance, I had a chance to ride Bombtrack Arise. A single speed, steel gravel bike. I was in love again.

I'm not a fast rider, so when it comes to gearing, comfortable climbing is more important to me than going fast. Finding the perfect ratio for a single speed takes time and lots of cogs, but this bike came with what seems to be the perfect ratio for me: 42 tooth chainring and 17 tooth rear sprocket. With 28" tires it yields 69 gear inches, which works very well for the steepest hills in my area and is good enough for descents.

This [handy bike calculator](https://www.bikecalc.com/fixed) helps to figure out the good ratio for a given cadence and speed. For my new bike, 90 rpm produces 28.4 km/h, and the high cadence of 130 rpm yields 41 km/h.

Single speed forces me to be more disciplined and think ahead. I can't just attack a hill on a granny gear anymore, I have to save as much momentum as possible. At the same time, this creates ultimate freedom. I don't think about optimal gearing, I am always in the ~~wrong~~ right gear.

I am yet to take Bombtrack on a truly long ride, and it might not be as peachy as I describe. But
