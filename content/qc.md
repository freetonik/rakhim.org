title: Quantum Computing (Budapest)
---

The most widely used cryptography today is based upon a handful of ideas from number theory. The key to the security of most communications in the world lies in the sheer scale of the computation required to break codes. But some quantum algorithms will definitely reduce the computation time from billions of years to few hours, rendering modern cryptography useless. How will cryptography survive the rise of quantum computing? Or is there nothing to worry about?

The presentation was held at #BSidesBUD2019 IT Security Conference in Budapest, Hungary on March 28, 2019.
