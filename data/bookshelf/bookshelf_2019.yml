  - title: "Ball Lightning"
    author: "Liu Cixin"
    isbn: "9781510088887"
    comment: |
      I was so excited to start another Liu Cixin's book after finishing The Three Body Problem. It starts very slowly, and I almost gave up. Then it speeds up and, omg, quantum mechanics, new ideas, so, so promising and fascinating... and then boom, it completely disintegrated in my eyes. It takes the most woo-woo pseudo-quantum-mechanics approach possible and talks about conscious observers affecting the quantum states. Close your eyes or the state is gonna collapse!

  - title: "Atomic Habits"
    author: "James Clear"
    isbn: "9781792781483"
    comment: |
      I don't know... Neither this nor another popular book about habits (How Habits Work by Charles Duhigg) were particularly interesting to me. There's just isn't that much mechanics involved in habit formation, and, if I may, it's pretty obvious when you try to be mindful. The key insight for me is that mindfulness and self-reflection are the root tools that help in many fields, while books about habits focus on a particular field and attend to replace conclusions and thought process with information. Both books are filled with useful advice. I just don't like the idea of manufacturing habits.

  - title: "Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less"
    author: "Greg McKeown"
    isbn: "9780753550281"
    comment: |
      Make no mistake — as any self-help book, this too could be shortened to a medium-sized blog post. Somewhat ironic. Yet, it's a pleasant read, filled with interesting stories and references. In an ongoing battle with the complexities of systems, life and work, I found this book deeply calming.

  - title: "Digital Minimalism"
    author: "Cal Newport"
    isbn: "9783868817256"
    comment: |
      Regardless of your level of "readiness" — whether you already think about your digital life a lot or not — this book could be a tremendous motivator and the beginning of a long journey. Cal talks about social media and electronic devices in the same fashion we tend to talk about food or alcohol or vice in general. It's a very good book and I wish more people read it.

  - title: "Will Save the Galaxy for Food"
    author: "Yahtzee Croshaw"
    isbn: "9781543601374"
    comment: |
      Funny and quirky, feels like a nice TV show, and I mean this in the best possible sense. Yahtzee's narration in the audiobook version is excellent, and I recommend the audiobook over the traditional book. And if you find his voice familiar, then yeah, it's the same Yahtzee that does Zero Punctuation game reviews.

  - title: "Something Deeply Hidden: Quantum Worlds and the Emergence of Spacetime"
    author: "Sean Carroll"
    featured: yes
    isbn: "9781786076342"
    comment: |
      Sean Carrol, a physicist, wonderful speaker and author, talks about the Many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, describes its difficult history and implications. As with his other books (and a fantastic podcast), it's deeply philosophical, engaging and extremely weird, just like our universe. I highly recommend his books and talks to anyone, even if you're not interested in quantum physics in particular.

  - title: "Stillness Is the Key"
    author: "Ryan Holiday"
    isbn: "9781788162050"
    comment: |
      Very concise, very well written, beautiful book. But I'd say its goal is to inspire or maybe motivate, but not to teach. Also (and I realize I'm in the minority here), sport and athletes references are extremely non-relatable.

  - title: "No More Mr. Nice Guy"
    author: "Robert A. Glover"
    isbn: "9781417597390"
    comment: |
      Very self-help-y, with all those obnoxious "exercises" and "mantras", but was very relevant to me. I'm an experienced nice guy and people pleaser, and as I'm trying to change certain aspects of my behavior, I've found this book helpful.

  - title: "The Antidote"
    author: "Oliver Burkeman"
    featured: yes
    isbn: "9781480527843"
    comment: |
      I really enjoyed the book, but have to admit, it's mostly preaching to the choir. Regardless, it's a very well written and easy to read book which manages to incorporate stories and anecdotes into serious discussions in a non-obnoxious way.

  - title: "The End of Eternity"
    author: "Isaac Asimov"
    featured: yes
    isbn: "9782207250655"
    comment: |
      Re-reading this for the Nth time. One of my all time science fiction favorites. It's pretty simple, compared to some mind-bending scifi of modern time, but hell, the story, the flow, the scale, it's just great. I'm actually not a fan of Asimov, couldn't ever finish any of the Foundation books. So, if you had tried Asimov and it didn't stick, try "The End of Eternity".

  - title: "Bullshit Jobs: A Theory"
    author: "David Graeber"
    isbn: "9781508264668"
    comment: |
      You know what this is about. No surprises here. The book itself is fun and quirky.

  - title: "21 Lessons for the 21st Century"
    author: "Yuval Noah Harari"
    featured: yes
    isbn: "9789400404960"
    comment: |
      A very well written bird's eye view of the humanity landscape. Empathetic and neutral at the same time. I want to Yuval's other books now.

  - title: "Astrophysics for People in a Hurry"
    author: "Neil deGrasse Tyson"
    featured: yes
    isbn: "9789462987043"
    comment: |
      Neil is great, as always. Entertaining and inspiring overview of astrophysics. His audiobook version is fantastic, too.

  - title: "The Sleep Revolution: Transforming Your Life, One Night at a Time"
    author: "Arianna Huffington"
    isbn: "9780753557198"
    comment: |
      A terrible way to learn about sleep. Just watch some lectures on YouTube.

  - title: "Money: Know More, Make More, Give More"
    author: "Rob Moore"
    isbn: "9781473671027"
    comment: |
      Ouch, that was cringy and boring. Wow, I've read some bad books in 2019 for some reason...

  - title: "Artificial Intelligence: The Basics"
    author: "Kevin Warwick"
    isbn: "9781283459563"
    comment: |
      An okay overview, nicely written, but make no mistake, this is truly the basics.

  - title: "The Bullet Journal Method"
    author: "Ryder Carroll"
    isbn: "9783499633409"
    comment: |
      The Bullet Journal method had helped me make sense of a very complicated period of my life, but I haven't used it in years since. This book re-ignited my interest and provided with some inspiration. It's a self-help book, alright, but not too typical. Ryder seems to be a genuinely good person.


  - title: "Programming the Universe"
    author: "Seth Lloyd"
    isbn: "9788959090310"
    comment: |
      It's a very interesting book, and you should try it. But... I can't recommend it to someone who doesn't know a little bit about quantum mechanics or computing or programming already. It covers a lot of topics and never goes into real explanation. And those time that it does, the metaphors and analogies are the same that other authors and even journalists use. In an attempt to make an approachable book, the author delivers a lot of starting points, but not a lot of meat. Oh, and there are a few illustrations that serve zero purpose, like a full page picture of three balls with arrows, trying to convey the idea of electron spin. But a few pages later there's a complex explanation with multiple changing variables that's impossible to track without re-reading multiple times or taking notes — a great place to actually illustrate!

  - title: "World War Z"
    author: "Max Brooks"
    isbn: "9782702139738"
    comment: |
      So cool! The book has nothing to do with the movie though, thank god. It's such a great format, delivered masterfully. The audio book features the author himself, interviewing the zombie war survivors! If you like this one, check out the last chapters of "Lock In" by John Scalzi. It's a similar pseudo-documentary about another kinds of apocalypse.


  - title: "The War of Art"
    author: "Steven Pressfield"
    isbn: "9781936891047"
    comment: |
      An interesting idea with good potential — resistance as a somewhat material force that manifests itself as procrastination and other phenomena — leading to nowhere. This book was so promising in the beginning, and utterly underwhelming throughout.


  - title: "Bird by Bird: Some Instructions on Writing and Life"
    author: "Anne Lamott"
    isbn: "9780385480017"
    featured: yes
    comment: |
      Wonderful, delightful, warm and intimate read. Even though I'm not a fan of the writing style often used in this book, I can honestly appreciate its simplicity, clarity and robustness. It's a no-nonsense, straight writing guide with a person's face.

  - title: "On Writing Well: The Classic Guide to Writing Nonfiction"
    author: "William Zinsser"
    isbn: "9780965647625"
    featured: yes
    comment: |
      If I could incorporate 10% of the ideas and recommendations from this book, I'd be 400% happier about my writing. Read this book if you write anything, even if it's limited to twitter. If you blog, then there's no excuse not to pick this up and always have it on your desk.

  - title: "Armada"
    author: "Ernest Cline"
    isbn: "9780804149112"
    comment: |
      I've enjoyed it, in the same way I've enjoyed silly teen movies. I really wanted to love this, several years after reading "Ready Player One", but alas, Armada was too shallow, too predictable and too... basic? It felt so much like a recipe: a nerd outcast protagonist, a father figure, nerd and non-mainstream culture, everyone is always in on the jokes, mix-tapes and old movies... There is no depth about anything: characters, plot, ideas, twist. Several anti-climaxes along the way and extremely predictable ending. In general, this feels exactly how it tries not to feel: pop-culture-y, cheap, youtube-attention-seeker-y and clickbait-y. Ernest Cline has to expand, or he will become "that guy who writes about geeks", while his intended target audience grows disappointed.

  - title: "How to Design Programs: An Introduction to Programming and Computing "
    author: "Matthias Felleisen,  Robert Bruce Findler, Matthew Flatt"
    isbn: "9780262332866"
    featured: yes
    comment: |
      Solid, comprehensive introduction to programming. I'm not sure I'd recommend this book freely, since I'd need to know a little bit about the person first. This is not for everybody, just like SICP (even more so). I think HTDP's primary use case is being a textbook with a good, passionate teacher. If only CS departments could replace useless "software engineering" and "Java OOP" courses with a multi-course series based on HTDP and/or SICP, we'd live in a better place.

  - title: "The Nordic Theory of Everything"
    author: "Anu Partanen"
    isbn: "9780062316554"
    comment: |
      Didn't finish this book, but only because I'm very much not the target audience. It's one of those "Hey, Americans, check out this not American thing, can you believe that, crazy, right?" reads.

  - title: "Diamond Dogs, Turquoise Days"
    author: "Alastair Reynolds"
    isbn: "9780575087705"
    featured: yes
    comment: |
      Two wonderful novellas, filled with the spirit of adventurous and mysterious science fiction. Turquoise Days is my favorite.
