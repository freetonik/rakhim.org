The reason I bike long distances is junk food. The formal justifications include physical activity, exploration and escape, but they all feel shallow and fake. I just love junk food. But I hate myself for eating it. The only time I can truly enjoy a grease cheeseburger with disgusting fries and a can of beer is after biking for 6 hours non-stop. 

This feels wrong and stupid. Yet, I find more and more "honestly-stupid" kind of reasons in life. I meet with people so that I can be alone again, but this time, finally, without the need to socialize. Travel to be able to be home. Run to sleep. Work to rest. 

Is that it?..
